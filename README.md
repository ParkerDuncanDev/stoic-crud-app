# Stoic Quote Board
This was an early CRUD exercise that I used to test out the Materialize CSS framework

**Link to project:** https://stoic-quote-board.herokuapp.com


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, js.Node, Express, MongoDB, Materialize

The application uses HTML/EJS, CSS(Materialize) and Javascript for the front end providing a familiar and standard view and interface for the user. js.Node handles the back end request with clean and readable code thanks to the Express library. MongoDB atlas provides a fast and straightforward database for the application to reference.

## Lessons Learned:
 How JSON is sent and parsed via HTTPS.
 
 Writing effecient and readable async functions on both front and backend.
 
 ParentNode/ChildNode javascript manipulation triggering via Fetch API requests and async/await
